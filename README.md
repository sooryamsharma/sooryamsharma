  Hi there 👋 I'm Suryam 👨‍💻
</h1>

<p align='center'></p>

I am a Software Engineer at Ernst & Young, and a recent graduate in Computer Science from the University of Texas--Arlington. I am currently looking for full-time job opportunities as a Machine Learning Engineer.

Technically I am well versed in Java, Python, Spring Boot, Kafka Streams, Kafka ETL, SQL, AWS. And professionally experienced in collaboratively working with team members in test-driven development and identifying, troubleshooting, and decoding software defects to ensure projects are completed on time and exceed all expectations. This combination of skills has prepared me to contribute to a team effort in the design, development, integration and delivery of software/web applications. 

During my master's I had hands-on experience with various Machine Learning technologies such as the use of deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or traditional Machine Learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Dynamic Time Warping, Markov Decision Process, Reinforcement Learning, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principle Component Analysis, K Nearest Neighbors, K-means clustering, Naive Bayes classifier, Linear and Logistic Regression. 

My master's thesis was on Human Pose Estimation, a sub-domain of Computer Vision. It is titled: "Adversarial Learning for Human Pose Estimation". I had implemented Generative Adversarial Convolutional Networks in order to achieve Structure-awareness in Human Pose Estimation https://github.com/sooryamsharma/adv-pose-estimation. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my SnowPro certification exam.
